please note: As of 04-10-2014 - the image path within <a href="https://github.com/sni-interactive-ad-experience/Interactive-Ad-Templates/blob/master/FN%20Redesign%20Modules/FN%20RSI/xml/template.xml">template.xml<a/> (&lt;imagePath&gt;) has changed on the server and should be examined closely upon entering data from Excel.

New structure will be similar to: http://img.foodnetwork.com/FOOD/2014/03/28/

Remember it should be a base path for all images.
Example: http://img.foodnetwork.com/FOOD/2014/03/28/

Then keywords.xml will supply each image individually.
